I am loved by your family.
You are appreciated by everyone in the office.
The cookies were eaten by the children.
The project, despite being managed by professionals, failed to meet the deadline.
The cake is baked by your grandmother.
The letter has been sent by the postman.
The song was sung by the choir.
The rules must be followed by everyone.
