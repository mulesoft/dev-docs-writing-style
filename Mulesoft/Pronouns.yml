  "Do not use gender-specific languages like '%s'. Replace with a gender-neutral noun indicating the person's role, such as user, customer, administrator, or developer.
  When necessary, you can use the plural pronoun to refer to individuals: "they," "them," and "their." Use "its" for a group such as a business or organization."
