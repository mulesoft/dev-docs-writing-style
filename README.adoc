= MuleSoft Developer Documentations Writing Style

This repository contains a https://github.com/errata-ai/vale[Vale-compatible] implementation of the MuleSoft Writing Style Guide, which is loosely based on the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/[Microsoft Writing Style Guide^]. 
link:LICENSE[LICENSE]

The primary purpose of this repository is to enforce the writing style of the https://docs.mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Technical Documentation^]. It contains the style rules in the form of a series of yaml files, which are used by Vale to automatically lint the documentation content via Github actions.
